## BUFFER EXAMPLE

## BUFFER?
App that manages its customers' social media accounts to grow their business through their followers' engagement rate, fast response, and planning their campaigns.

## Old salary formula
 salary= job type*seniority* experience+location+(10k$ if you choose salary instead of equity)


---
## Why change?
*  Keeping up with pay benchmarks across a large number of sites has been a major problem. 
* Difficulty to explain how the formula worked to both existing and new team members who were obtaining promotions.
* Buffer shares their successes, mistakes, strengths, and decisions in order to live up to their value of "Defaulting to transparency."
